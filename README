0. Install python on your computer/host by https://www.python.org/downloads/

1. Install skrf by 
	pip install scikit-rf
		OR
	following https://scikit-rf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/Installation.html

2. Install other libraries as
	pip install Matplotlib
	pip install numpy

2a: If possible install gsutil following https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil_install.
    This is used to upload logs into gcloud.
    If gcloud is NOT installed, comnment out the lines starting with "gsutil" from 
	run_calculate_yield.sh	
	run_good_bad_filter.sh

3. Create files. This is a little involved and I write steps for this in the presentation slide.
     pass_band_frequencies
     stop_band_left_frequencies
     stop_band_right_frequencies

4. To run do
	run_calculate_yield.sh 
	// After seeing the graph close it. 


5. The code will print many lines (Used for debugging. Will be removed later).
   After code is done, scroll few pages up to see

Yield=98.9795918367347 
             ('Yield in PASS_BAND_Thresholds = 0 to -24  STOP_BAND_Thresholds=-30 to -200;  Number of filters processed=98 good_filters=97 Yield=', 98.9795918367347)

This is the best yield and there are multiple thresholds that result in this yield.


6. To check good-pass filter for each file do
	run_good_bad_filter.sh <filename>
